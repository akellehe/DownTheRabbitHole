# Down The Rabbit Hole

This is the code for the [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Down-the-Rabbit-Hole-Exploring-Distributed-Systems) "Down The Rabbit Hole: Exploring Distributed Systems".

You can find us there. I'll keep adding to this repo as we cover more topics. Feel free to contribute with erratta, improvements, fixes, and unit tests.

Our slides are in [this public folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o52MaTq4_dKzD0RBV6W-4xidpUOygVXD). Feel free to poke around and reach out if you have any questions or if you think you might be interested in speaking.
